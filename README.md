ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ameen â€” a software engineer and MSCS candidate at Case Western Reserve University, passionate about backend systems, AI, and emerging tech.

With experience spanning healthcare, crypto, and robotics, Iâ€™ve built scalable services in Go, crafted ML models for computer vision, and led projects from architecture to deployment. My work includes collaborations with Samsung R&D, national disaster agencies, and fast-paced startups.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new tech stacks through hands-on, experimental projects â€” from AI-powered ad creators to smart email agents and voice-based interview bots.

Letâ€™s connect and build whatâ€™s next.
